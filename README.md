System analysis and design module 8 assignment

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  The DriverPass project was a project where we had to design a system for a driving school that handled all appointments, scheduling, and class registration.

What did you do particularly well?
  I think I wasa quite good at recognizing what the client (DriverPass) needed and creating an outline/plan a program that they could benefit from.
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I struggled with the UML's. For the life of me I couldn't figure out how to visualize everything. I knew how a program would function in my head but struggled to put it on paper

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I would read the user's needs and think to myself "is this a function I have seen anywhere else on similar systems?" and if the answer is yes then its probably worth implementing that feature. However if the answer is no then it could be worth asking the client what they mean by a certain feature and how they believe it can benefit the system.
  
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  I think it's best to approach designing software like a puzzle. There's a solution to pretty much any problem it'll just take time to get there and you need to figure out that solution. I think it is beneficial to create things like UML or Pseudocode because it helps you understand what you're trying to do. I think creating a UML is only practical when you're designing an entire system but can still be hard to figure out how everything will interact. Sometimes it's easier to start with a very general and broad idea then break everything down so it almost becomes pyramidal.
